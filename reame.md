# Gold Price Forecasting Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze historical gold price trends and forecast future prices using various statistical and machine learning models. Gold is a crucial asset in financial markets, and predicting its price movements can provide valuable insights for investors, economists, and policymakers. This analysis leverages time series forecasting techniques to generate short-term and long-term predictions while evaluating model performance.

## Data Preprocessing
### Dataset Preparation
- The dataset consists of historical monthly gold prices spanning multiple decades.
- The date column is converted into a datetime format and set as the index to facilitate time series analysis.
- Missing values, if any, are handled appropriately using interpolation or removal strategies.
- Outliers are detected and examined for potential errors or irregularities.

### Data Splitting
- The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance effectively.
- An 80-20 split is used, where 80% of the data is used for training and 20% for testing.
- Scaling techniques are applied where necessary to improve model convergence and performance.

## Data Analysis
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Trend Analysis:** Visualizations of gold price movements over time to identify long-term trends.
- **Seasonality Detection:** Examination of seasonal patterns using decomposition techniques.
- **Boxplot Analysis:** Yearly and quarterly boxplots are used to analyze price distributions, trends, and volatility.
- **Summary Statistics:** Key statistical measures such as mean, median, variance, and standard deviation are computed for different time periods.

## Forecasting Models
### 1. Linear Regression Model
- **Methodology:**
  - The model is trained using time as the independent variable and gold price as the dependent variable.
  - A regression line is fitted to predict future prices.
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Model accuracy is evaluated using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
  - Residual analysis is performed to check for non-linearity and autocorrelation issues.

### 2. Naive Forecast Model
- **Methodology:**
  - This model assumes that the last observed value is the best estimate for future prices.
  - A benchmark model for comparing more sophisticated forecasting techniques.
- **Performance Evaluation:**
  - Compared with the linear regression model using MAPE.
  - Examines whether complex models provide significant improvements over simple heuristics.

### 3. ARIMA Model
- **Methodology:**
  - Conducted stationarity tests (ADF Test) and differencing to remove trends.
  - Used Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots to determine optimal ARIMA (p, d, q) parameters.
  - Trained ARIMA model and generated short-term forecasts.
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Evaluated using RMSE and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
  - Checked residual plots for any patterns indicating model deficiencies.

### 4. SARIMA Model
- **Methodology:**
  - Extended ARIMA by incorporating seasonality parameters (P, D, Q, S).
  - Aimed to capture periodic fluctuations in gold prices.
- **Performance Evaluation:**
  - Compared with ARIMA to determine if adding seasonality improves predictions.
  - Forecasting accuracy assessed over different time horizons.

### 5. Long-Term Forecasting (10-Year and 30-Year Projections)
- **Methodology:**
  - A naive forecast is extended for 10 and 30 years into the future.
  - Confidence intervals (Â±5%) are included to estimate uncertainty.
- **Results:**
  - Predictions suggest stable prices based on historical trends.
  - Long-term forecasts are visualized to assess potential future movements.

## Results and Insights
- **Model Comparisons:**
  - The naive forecast outperformed the linear regression model based on MAPE.
  - ARIMA and SARIMA provided improved accuracy over simpler models.
- **Future Trend Projections:**
  - Prices appear stable with minor fluctuations over extended periods.
  - External factors such as inflation, geopolitical events, and market conditions could impact future predictions.

## Usage and Implementation
To replicate this analysis:
1. Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Ensure dependencies such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, and Sklearn are installed.
3. Run the provided scripts to preprocess the data, analyze trends, and generate forecasts.
4. Adjust model parameters and compare different forecasting techniques to optimize predictions.

## Future Work
- **Advanced Machine Learning Models:** Implement deep learning models such as LSTMs or Facebook Prophet for improved forecasting accuracy.
- **External Factor Analysis:** Incorporate macroeconomic indicators like inflation rates, stock market indices, and interest rates to refine predictions.
- **Confidence Interval Enhancement:** Improve uncertainty estimations using bootstrapping and probabilistic modeling.
