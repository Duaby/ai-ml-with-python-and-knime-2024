## Introduction

This Kaggle project provides code for forecasting the price of gold using various time series forecasting methods. The dataset used for the analysis is the daily price of gold in USD from 1950-01 to 2020-07, with a total of 847 data points. The Jupyter notebook included in the repository contains code for building and evaluating three different time series forecasting models, namely Linear Regression Model, Naive Model, and Exponential Smoothing Model. The Exponential Smoothing Model performed the best with a MAPE score of 17.235%. The predicted gold prices for the period 2020-08 to 2025-02 using the Exponential Smoothing Model are also provided in a CSV file named gold_price_predictions.csv. The dataset, code, and results can be accessed through the Kaggle project and Github repository provided in the references.
